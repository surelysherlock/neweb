            <p>The old home button afforded Samsung a number of advantages, some of which are already causing a few grumbles among those deciding whether or not to pick up the Galaxy S8.</p>

            <p>For starters, the new fingerprint scanner’s placement is now rather unconventional. The old design, housed inside the home button, lent itself nicely to a quick thumb press, without having to rearrange our hands from the familiar typing position.</p>

            <p>Removing the home button means that Samsung has had to find a new place for its fingerprint scanner. In some ways, it’s a shame that Samsung didn’t find a way to implement an under-the-screen solution that would have kept the old convenience.</p>

            <p>Instead of placing the scanner in the middle on the back, as other manufacturers have done, Samsung has moved the module to the side of the camera. A decision with comes with a few pros and cons of its own, as I’ve discussed before. Samsung itself seems to realize the location is less than ideal, adding a reminder to the S8’s camera app to periodically clean the camera lens.</p>
